FEATURE ROADMAP (sort of!)
	- ANIMALS
		- It's probably easiest to define each animal type as its own subclass... too much variation in behavior to just use json file. 
			- Dog
			- Cat
			- Horse
			- Cow
			- Sheep
			- Chicken
			- Duck?
			- Alpaca?
			- Pig? (sadface - not much to do but slaughter them D:)
			- ...
		- Animal trait types: brushable, home building (barn or coop), liftable, ...
		- Individual animals have names, heart levels, happiness? (combo of fed/outside on sunny day/petted/etc), fed status, brushed status (some), pet status, sickness, pregnancy (for some only), item-harvest-status (some only, and varies -- e.g., sheep harvest per 3 days), location (in barn or out), colors? (e.g., black or white sheep!)
		- Incubator for eggs and pregnancy potion for mammals :)


	- PEOPLE
		- Villagers can def be in JSON files... :)
		- Villagers have: name, gender, romanceable, friendship/heart level, birthdates, likes/dislikes (probably more like loathes/hates/neutral/likes/loves), schedules (at this time and optionally on this day, go here and stay here, with a default and a priority order), 
		- Villagers have dialog that varies a lot. Might put this in a separate file. Depends on:
			- friendship level / relationship status
			- location / villager's activity
			- weather, season
			- current festivals going on, if any
			- ... ???
			- also a bit random. talking to them twice = 2 different results probably.

		- Villagers have events associated with their romance/friendship level but therae my be other requirements? (think about how to implement this)
			- e.g., location (exit farmhouse), day (day before a romantic festival)...
			- each event, probably its own file (same as below?)

		- Villagers should also have (possibly repeatable) visits to your house
			- cutscenes from mayor dude (blah blah welcome to farm)
			- romance interests delivering cookies on romantic cookie day


	- ITEMS
		- Cooking and crafting (recipes)
			- Add tagging support to generic items to allow creation of semi-generic recipes
				* For example, we could have an item with the "rootVegetable" tag plus the "oil" item = roasted veggie. 
				  Items with the rootVegetable tag aren't necessarily in the same part of the hierarchy. Consider potato (crop) vs bamboo shoot.
				* Tagging could also be used for villager likes/dislikes ("cute", "shiny", "garbage", etc...)

	- BUILDINGS AND FURNITURE
		- Most buildings have a starting level and can be upgraded, e.g., your main house starts small and can expand in size, add rooms etc
		- Some buildings build from scratch: chicken coop, barn, greenhouse, maybe luxury cabins?
		- Housing buildings can also have furniture installed
			- Kitchen appliances such as stove, knife, pot, etc.
			- Big bed
			- Cabinet, tool chest, fridge, ...
			- TV
			- ...
